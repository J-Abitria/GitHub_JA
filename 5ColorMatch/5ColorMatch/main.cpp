	Description: This is a game where 5 different colors are randomly mixed up. The player has to guess the order that the colors are
	assigned, character by character. The player does not get to know which colors are in the correct position, only being told the number
	of colors that are in the correct spot. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the order of the colors. The goal is to guess
	the order in as few guesses as possible.
