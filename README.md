#### 5 Color Match [C++] (4/26/2024) <br>
- A game where 5 colors are randomly scrambled by the computer. The user must figure out the order of the colors in the fewest guesses possible. The user is only told how many colors they have correctly arranged, and not which ones. <br>
#### Hold The Place [C++] (4/29/2024) <br>
- A game in the style of the Tower Defense genre, enemies spawn in waves while the player must prevent them from reaching the exit. The player loses if their health reaches 0, they win if all waves are cleared. <br>
- The player is given 20 HP, and 10 starting mana. Each tower costs 10 mana. Towers are placed using left and right click. Left click places a Fire Tower (dealing single target damage), right click places a Lightning Tower (dealing chain damage to 3 targets).
#### Schedule Planner [C++] (5/13/2024) <br>
- An application where the user can schedule events for every day of the week, organized by the time of day, formatted in military time. Data for the schedule can be saved and loaded from a .csv file as the user desires. Events can be added, edited, or deleted. <br>
#### Stocks Simulator [C++] (5/14/2024) <br>
- A simulator of seven different stocks of varying volatility. Users can press the number key corresponding to the stock they wish to interact with, either to buy stock or sell existing shares, the goal to maximize profit. Stock prices update every 2 seconds by a random percentage, and the user can press Esc at any time to exit the simulator.
#### Breakout Clone [C#] [Unity] (6/5/2024) <br>
- A clone of the classic brick breaker Breakout. First experience using the Unity engine, scene management. Created in Unity 2D URP. Play the game and download the files at https://jabi-jpeg.itch.io/breakoutclone
#### Hexapawn AI [C++] (6/23/2024) <br>
- A program running the game Hexapawn, a game on a 3x3 board with each side having 3 pawns each. The player wins the game by pushing a pawn to the other side of the board, capturing all opposing pawns, or leaving the opponent with no legal move. The AI in the program originally plays randomly, but will improve its moves the longer the player plays against it until it becomes unbeatable. The AI utilizes a database of moves to track legal moves and losing moves.
#### MazeMaker [C++] (8/04/2024) <br>
- A program that randomly generates a square maze of a size that is determined by the user. The maze can be as small as 5x5 or as large as 20x20. A start and end point is randomly generated at an edge or corner of the maze where only one neighboring path exists. Once generated, the maze is then solved by the computer using a depth-first search algorithm, tracking the path taken to exit the maze, and tracking any encountered dead ends in its search.
#### Close the Castle [C#] [Unity] (WIP) <br>
- Creating a TD game inspired by Hold the Place, improving upon the mechanics and expanding the game.
