#### 5 Color Match [C++] (4/26/2024) <br>
- A game where 5 colors are randomly scrambled by the computer. The user must figure out the order of the colors in the fewest guesses possible. The user is only told how many colors they have correctly arranged, and not which ones. <br>
#### Hold The Place [C++] (4/29/2024) <br>
- A game in the style of the Tower Defense genre, enemies spawn in waves while the player must prevent them from reaching the exit. The player loses if their health reaches 0, they win if all waves are cleared. <br>
- The player is given 20 HP, and 10 starting mana. Each tower costs 10 mana. Towers are placed using left and right click. Left click places a Fire Tower (dealing single target damage), right click places a Lightning Tower (dealing chain damage to 3 targets).
#### Schedule Planner [C++] (5/13/2024) <br>
- An application where the user can schedule events for every day of the week, organized by the time of day, formatted in military time. Data for the schedule can be saved and loaded from a .csv file as the user desires. Events can be added, edited, or deleted. <br>
